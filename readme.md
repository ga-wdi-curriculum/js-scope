# Scope and Context

This lesson will cover two concepts commonly covered in interview questions: Scope and Context. Why is that so? Because these are some of Javascript's most unique and nuanced features.

This lesson is going to feel more conceptual than previous ones and will make use of examples that may seem a bit contrived. Just know that these are for demonstration purposes. What's important is that, by the class' end, you can provide a definition for these concepts and support them with examples.

# Part I: [Scope](scope.md)
# Part II: [Context](context.md)

# Additional Reading
- Closely related to the concept of scope is the concept of [closures](closures.md).
